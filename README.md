# filehandler

Light-weight header library defining a class with only static methods to implement "files" which can store arrays of values indexed by keywords. In fact each file is a directory with the "keys" the individual files within the directory.
Currently only handles simple int, float, long and double arrays and assumes a POSIX file system.
